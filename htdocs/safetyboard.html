<h3><a class="anchor" href="#what">What is the Tor Research Safety
Board?</a></h3>
<br>

<p>
We are a group of researchers who study Tor, and who want to <b>minimize
privacy risks while fostering a better understanding of the Tor network
and its users</b>. We aim to accomplish this goal in three ways:

<ol>
<li>developing and maintaining a set of guidelines that researchers can
use to assess the safety of their Tor research.</li>
<li>giving feedback to researchers who use our guidelines to assess the
safety of their planned research.</li>
<li>teaching program committees about our guidelines, and encouraging
reviewers to consider research safety when reviewing Tor papers.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<a id="guidelines"></a>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#guidelines">What are the safety
guidelines?</a></h3>
<br>

<p>
Here's a start:

<ol>
<li>Use a test Tor network whenever possible.
<li>It's safest to only attack yourself / your own traffic.
<li>Only collect data that is safe to make public.
<li>Don't collect data you don't need (minimization).
<li>Take reasonable security precautions, e.g. about who has access to
your data sets or experimental systems.
<li>Limit the granularity of data (e.g. use bins or add noise).
<li>The benefits should outweigh the risks.
<li>Consider auxiliary data (e.g. third-party data sets) when assessing
the risks.
<li>Consider whether the user meant for that data to be private.
</ol>

<p>
There's plenty of room for further improvement here. In fact, we think
this list itself is a really interesting research area. One of our next
steps is to flesh out each of these points with a few paragraphs of
explanation. Please help!

<hr>
<a id="how"></a>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#how">How can I submit a request for advice?</a></h3>
<br>

<p>
The vision is that you (the researchers) think through the safety
of your planned activity, write up an assessment based on our guidelines,
and send
it to us. Then we look it over and advise you about how to make your
plan safer, how to make your arguments crisper, or what parts really
seem too dangerous to do. Later (e.g. when your paper gets published) we'll
encourage you to make your assessment public. Over time we'll grow a
library of success cases, which will provide best practices guidance
for being safe, and also provide templates for writing good assessments.

<p>
We hope that going through this process will help you think clearly
about the benefits and risks of your experiment. Hopefully our feedback
on your thoughts will help too. At the same time, this process will help
Tor by letting us know what research is happening &mdash; which in turn
can help you, since we might be able to let you know about a concurrent
experiment (with their permission of course) that will mess up your
results. Also, we can let you know about upcoming Tor design changes
that might influence your plans or analysis.

<p>
To best help you, we want to hear about four aspects of your proposed
experiment or research plan:
<ol>
<li>What are you trying to learn, and why is that useful for the
world? That is, what are the hoped-for benefits of your experiment?
<li>What exactly is your plan? That is, what are the steps of your
experiment, what will you collect, how will you keep it safe, and
so on.
<li>What attacks or risks might be introduced or assisted because of your
actions or your data sets, and how well do you resolve each of them? Use
the "safety guidelines" above to help in the brainstorming and analysis.
<li>Walk us through why the benefits from item 1 outweigh the remaining
risks from item 3: why is this plan worthwhile despite the remaining
risks?
</ol>

<p>We encourage you to include your assessment as a section of your
research paper: one of the goals here is that reviewers on
program committees come to expect a section in Tor papers that explains
what mechanisms the researchers used for ensuring that privacy risks
were handled, and argues that the balance between new understanding
and risk is worthwhile. For space reasons, you might include a streamlined
version in the main body of the paper and a more detailed version in
an appendix.

<p>
In the future, we'd like to come up with a more thorough template for
self-assessments, to help you make sure you don't miss any critical
areas. Please let us know what would help you most.

<p>Contact address coming soon. In the meantime, mailing Roger is not
a terrible plan.

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#faq">FAQ</a></h3>
<br>

<p><b>Why now?</b>
The importance of Tor is growing in the world, and interest from
researchers remains high as ever. Each week we run across a new paper
that maybe didn't think things through in terms of keeping their users
safe. We've seen lately that simply having a sensitive data set, even
if you plan to never give it out, can put users at real risk.
At the same time, we've seen exciting papers like PrivEx, which show
that studying how to do research safely can be a research field in itself.
Now is the perfect time for us to work to shape future research
so we build habits of safety in our community, and so we help people to
understand what is possible.

<p><b>What about bad people who don't care about being safe?</b>
A safety board cannot by itself stop all dangerous Tor research. Plenty
of people out there don't play the academic game, and some people don't
care about user safety at all. Our goal here is to support the people
who want to cooperate, while showing to the world that it's possible to
do good Tor research safely.

<p><b>Can't I just run Tor relays and do my experiment without telling you?</b>
Please don't! The directory authority operators have been much more
conservative
lately (after the CMU incident in particular) in terms of looking for
suspicious patterns or behavior, and removing suspicious relays from the
network. If the directory authority operators know about you, understand
your research, and can read about why the benefits are worth the risks
in your case, they will likely leave your relays in place, rather than
surprising you by kicking your relays out of the network mid experiment.

<p><b>Can I do this assessment and review process even if I'm not writing
an academic paper?</b>
Please do! Our goal as stated above is "to minimize privacy risks while
fostering a better understanding of the Tor network and its users". If
your end goal is something other than a research paper, that's great too.

<p><b>Is this an ethics board?</b>
We framed this idea as a safety board, not an ethics board. We think
safety is a narrower scope: we aim to describe <i>how</i> to be safe,
and we aim to make it the norm that reviewers and program committees
expect to see an analysis of why an experiment or measurement is safe. We
also are not adding new bottlenecks to the research process, such as
mandating that we have to vet the analysis first &mdash; that's ultimately
between the researchers and the program committees. We aren't trying to
replace IRBs or other projects like ethicalresearch.org.

<p><b>So I still need to go to my IRB?</b>
This safety board is orthogonal to the IRB concept. We hope that the
evaluation process here will help you organize your thoughts for your
IRB, but it does not replace your IRB process (if you have one).

<p><b>What about confidentiality?</b>
Unless you tell us otherwise, we will keep assessments that we receive
confidential in the same
way that program committees do. You're coming to us much earlier in
the process (ideally before the research is performed and before the
paper is written), which we recognize requires more trust. We hope we
add enough value to your research that you find this tradeoff worthwhile.

<p><b>How will you know the right balance between benefits and risks?</b>
This is a tough one. We want Tor to get stronger long-term, but we don't
want to put people into danger to do it. One answer is that most of this
board is made up of professors and other online safety, security, and
privacy researchers, who can provide
a more neutral perspective on the right balance. The other answer
is that this process is a feedback loop and we can adapt as we go:
once successful assessments have gone up on this page, and people are
including assessments in their papers, everybody else can look at them
and decide if they used the right balance.

<p><b>So you want conferences to adopt your guidelines?</b>
Not quite. We would be sad if program chairs told their reviewers "Make
sure the paper follows Tor's guidelines for safe research." We would
instead like the chairs to tell the reviewers "Make sure the paper has
performed safe research. If you're unsure what that means, I encourage
you to read Tor's guidelines to get ideas on what to consider." That is,
we want the reviewers to always be thinking through, for each paper,
whether this is a safe or unsafe situation. Reviewers should enforce
the ethical requirements of the conference they're reviewing for &mdash;
or their own ethical principles, if the conference neglected to have an
opinion on the topic. Our goal here is to help them think through what
to look for.

<p><b>Is Tor going to do this assessment process for its own design
decisions and statistics collection?</b>
Absolutely! You'll notice a big improvement over the years
between <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/13988">our
early statistics collection choices</a> and <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/some-statistics-about-onions">our
later ones</a>. That learning process is part of what led to this
safety board. We'd like to revisit many of Tor's design choices,
especially once we've worked through some other examples here. We'd
love to have your help there.
