Hi David,
Thanks for reaching out about conducting safer experiments on the Tor
network. I am taking the lead to assist you with that.
I have gone over your responses to the guide questions and think you
have done a pretty good job of figuring things out on your own.

I have created a template (to someday replace the more generic questions
on the webpage) that I am attaching here which is aimed at helping
researchers work through their methodology and aims. Since you have
already provided a lot of the responses, you can ignore those parts of
the document, but do take a look at section 3(a-c), 4, and 6(a-c). It is
more about how you'd do your experiments, store the data you collect,
and keep everything super safe.

The plan is to take those responses, get together and discuss/clarify
where needed, and then I would write a recommendation for you and the
board to consume stating whether your plan seems plausible. Since this
is our first time and still figuring things out ourselves there is a lot
of flexibility about how we go about this and the end result. Hopefully,
it will be useful for your project, and for the Tor community.

Look forward to hearing back from you.

Cheers,
Tariq

A draft template/questionaire to promote safer Tor experiments

1a. What are you trying to learn about? Is it:
- New algorithm(s) that enhances current algorithm(s) in Tor.
- New system that interacts with Tor.
- New attack(s) that degrade(s) Tor properties.
- The characteristics of the real-world Tor network and its clients, operators, network topology, etc.
- Something else.

1b. What about the above are you trying to learn? Is it:
- Performance enhancement/reduction.
- Security enhancement/reduction.
- Privacy enhancement/reduction.
- Actual real-world trends, details, etc of the Tor network.
-- Could we use this data to construct models about the Tor network?
- Something else.

1c. Why is it important to learn the above?
- It justifies the new algorithm/system/attack.
- It would reveal (alarming) significant information about the Tor network, and:
-- Tor should change its design (and we have suggestions on how).
-- We can model this aspect of the Tor network and use it henceforth (and avoid collecting data like this again).
- Something else.

2. Could you learn this by doing a closed-form analysis from the design?
- Yes, and it would be pretty close to reality.
- Yes, but it would not be realistic.
-- Can you estimate how significant a deviation you expect from the closed-form analysis compared to the real-world results? Is it more like a) anyone's guess, or b) bounded by some amount/factor.
- No, due to difficulties in performing closed-form analysis from the design.
- No, because it would not be the real-world behavior of the network. 

3a. What data points do you need to learn the above?
- How many?
- Over what time period and duration?
- From which vanatage points on the network? (e.g. clients, relays, directory servers, network, ISP, HSdir, etc).
- What granularity is the data that is collected.
- How will they be kept ``safe'' while they are collected and stored?
-- Describe what you mean by ``safe'' here.

3b. How do these data points tell you about the thing you want to learn about?
- Would it be conclusive?
- Would it be valid for only a snap-shot-in time?
- Would it have to be updated regularly to remain relevant?

3c. Does the data need to be released to justify your experiments/system?
- Yes.
-- With what granularity would it be reported?
-- Would it be obfuscated in some fashion?
- No. 
-- How will you justify your results instead?

4. Is there an alternative, and existing, source of data you could use instead of collecting your own?
- Yes.
- No, it
-- doesn't exist.
-- is too old.
-- is not released by the collector.

5. Could you evaluate your enhancement/attack on a (local) test Tor network?
- Yes.
- Yes, but limited by the models we could use.
- No, since the models we have are insufficient, or don't exist, or not robust enough. We need:
-- Realistic client behviour.
-- Realistic networking behaviour.
-- Realistic bandwidth and computation load.
-- Realistic system/Tor interaction.
- No, for another reason.

6. Describe your experimental methodology for running experiments to learn about/attack the live Tor-network.
6a. When running your experiment on the live-network, you will collect and/or process:
- Only data generated and realted to our own clients and nodes.
- The above as well as those of other users of the Tor network.
- Only data of other users of the Tor network.
6b. Will you introduce resources (relays and bandwidth) into the network.
- Yes.
-- We will run clients (honest but curious, and/or malicious).
-- We will run Directories (honest but curious, and/or malicious).
-- We will run relays (guard, middle, exit) (honest but curious, and/or malicious).
- No.
-- How will you observe/influence the network if not directly through Tor nodes?
6c. Will you run custom Tor code on your Tor nodes?
- Yes, but only to log certain events.
- Yes, but it changes the original behavior.
-- How would this affect the Tor network in general? Is it part of an attack? Describe the impact.
