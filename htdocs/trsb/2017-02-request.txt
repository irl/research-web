Subject: Privacy-Preserving Longevity Study of Hidden Services

Dear Tor Safety Board members,

We have a collaboration between three teams, Erik Blass (Airbus),
Aziz Mohaisen (University of Buffalo), Guevara Noubir (Northeastern
University), and have been working on the design of a privacy-preserving
study of the lifespan of hidden services. Please find attached our
proposed design. We look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Guevara
