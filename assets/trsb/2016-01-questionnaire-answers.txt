A draft template/questionaire to promote safer Tor experiments

1a. What are you trying to learn about? Is it:
- New algorithm(s) that enhances current algorithm(s) in Tor.
- New system that interacts with Tor.
- New attack(s) that degrade(s) Tor properties.
- The characteristics of the real-world Tor network and its clients, operators, network topology, etc.
- Something else.

The characteristics of the real-world Tor network and its clients, operators, network topology, etc.

1b. What about the above are you trying to learn? Is it:
- Performance enhancement/reduction.
- Security enhancement/reduction.
- Privacy enhancement/reduction.
- Actual real-world trends, details, etc of the Tor network.
-- Could we use this data to construct models about the Tor network?
- Something else.

Actual real-world trends, details, etc of the Tor network. It might be possible to construct better model.

1c. Why is it important to learn the above?
- It justifies the new algorithm/system/attack.
- It would reveal (alarming) significant information about the Tor network, and:
-- Tor should change its design (and we have suggestions on how).
-- We can model this aspect of the Tor network and use it henceforth (and avoid collecting data like this again).
- Something else.

Something else. We hope it can make Tor more censorship-resistant.

2. Could you learn this by doing a closed-form analysis from the design?
- Yes, and it would be pretty close to reality.
- Yes, but it would not be realistic.
-- Can you estimate how significant a deviation you expect from the closed-form analysis compared to the real-world results? Is it more like a) anyone's guess, or b) bounded by some amount/factor.
- No, due to difficulties in performing closed-form analysis from the design.
- No, because it would not be the real-world behavior of the network. 

No, because it would not be the real-world behavior of the network. 

3a. What data points do you need to learn the above?
- How many?
We will be testing the reachability of the default bridges.
- Over what time period and duration?
Indefinite.
- From which vanatage points on the network? (e.g. clients, relays, directory servers, network, ISP, HSdir, etc).
We test it from off the network.
- What granularity is the data that is collected.
It is only the reachability of different bridges during different time.
- How will they be kept ``safe'' while they are collected and stored?
We don't have any secret data. All our results will be published after our research.
-- Describe what you mean by ``safe'' here.

3b. How do these data points tell you about the thing you want to learn about?
- Would it be conclusive?
No, but it would give us better insights.
- Would it be valid for only a snap-shot-in time?
Yes.
- Would it have to be updated regularly to remain relevant?
Yes.

3c. Does the data need to be released to justify your experiments/system?
- Yes.
-- With what granularity would it be reported?
-- Would it be obfuscated in some fashion?
- No.
-- How will you justify your results instead?
Yes. We will obfuscate our probe locations. None of the other data is secret.

4. Is there an alternative, and existing, source of data you could use instead of collecting your own?
- Yes.
- No, it
-- doesn't exist.
-- is too old.
-- is not released by the collector.
No, it doesn't exist. We can use Tor collector data as supplyment though.

5. Could you evaluate your enhancement/attack on a (local) test Tor network?
- Yes.
- Yes, but limited by the models we could use.
- No, since the models we have are insufficient, or don't exist, or not robust enough. We need:
-- Realistic client behviour.
-- Realistic networking behaviour.
-- Realistic bandwidth and computation load.
-- Realistic system/Tor interaction.
- No, for another reason.
No. We need a realistic adversary.

6. Describe your experimental methodology for running experiments to learn about/attack the live Tor-network.
6a. When running your experiment on the live-network, you will collect and/or process:
- Only data generated and realted to our own clients and nodes.
- The above as well as those of other users of the Tor network.
- Only data of other users of the Tor network.
Only data generated and realted to our own clients and nodes.

6b. Will you introduce resources (relays and bandwidth) into the network.
- Yes.
-- We will run clients (honest but curious, and/or malicious).
-- We will run Directories (honest but curious, and/or malicious).
-- We will run relays (guard, middle, exit) (honest but curious, and/or malicious).
- No.
-- How will you observe/influence the network if not directly through Tor nodes?
We will run clients (honest but curious, and/or malicious).

6c. Will you run custom Tor code on your Tor nodes?
- Yes, but only to log certain events.
- Yes, but it changes the original behavior.
-- How would this affect the Tor network in general? Is it part of an attack? Describe the impact.
No.
