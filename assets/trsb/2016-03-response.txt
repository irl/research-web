Subject: Re: Tor Research Safety Board

Hi Kymberlee,

Here is the TRSB response to your proposal.
Please share with your team.

May the season make sense to you and yours,
Paul

----------------------------------------

Dear UMD Gemstone Team DIRE,

Thank you for your submission of proposed research to the Tor Research
Safety Board. Your proposal was reviewed by three members of the
Board. I have assembled this response from the reviews each has
given. There was no significant discussion since reviews were largely
in agreement.

Aside from safety considerations, all reviewers noted that they found
the research to be potentially quite interesting. That is not always
so, even for seasoned researchers much less undergraduates.  Thus
congratulations already in that respect.

All reviewers agreed that there are no Tor-specific safety concerns
for your research project. Nonetheless, all noted similar concerns
for such research on the Internet, whether concerning Tor or not.

Details can be found in the comments of each reviewer, included below.
But in summary the concerns are

1. Make sure that you take adequate security precautions for yourselves
not just those you research.

2. Be aware that when coding input from multiple sources, potential
exists for privacy or safety risks to emerge out of the synthesis,
even if the individual items being coded are safe in isolation.

3. What constitutes "public" information may not be black-and-white and
can have lots of context to it.

Any or all of these may require the input or analysis of your IRB. In
any case you should look over our comments and make sure that you are
both taking them into consideration yourselves and making appropriate
decisions with respect to your IRB.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or comments.
I look forward to seeing how your work progresses.

Sincerely,
Paul Syverson

Comments from Reviewer A

Based on the answers to the questionnaire, I would flag up the
following issues that may be helpful to the research team:

- The data collected is referred to as "public", and as I understand
  it consists of discussion forum posts etc associated with specific
  "darkweb" topics. While, the "public" nature of those posts does to
  some extent mitigate the risks introduced by the research per se,
  that data has the potential to be personally identifiable,
  particularly when it is subject to coding on the basis of the
  content. Thus I would advise the researchers to seek advice at their
  institution on whether specific protocols and approvals are needed
  when handling such PII. I know for a fact that institutions in the
  EU -- where horizontal data protection provisions are in place --
  would have to go through a (lightweight) approval process to collect
  and handle such personal information. Probably procedures to ensure
  the "anonymity" of the coded transcripts would also have to be
  described as part of the approval process.

- There is a little ambiguity in the description in relation to the
  phrase "compare the views and products of the marketplaces". This
  may mean simply browsing the pages of underground marketplaces,
  which I think is fine (subject to the above). However, if products
  are to be bought a certain amount of care should be taken. (1) the
  safety of researchers should be thought of when it comes to payment
  options, as well as shipping addresses -- ensuring that the
  researchers personal information does not end up in the hands of
  criminal organizations; (2) there are delicacies associated with
  purchasing controlled substances, or other restricted items or
  material from specific jurisdictions -- and probably some sound
  legal advice will be needed in case this is the plan; (3) there are
  ethical issues about providing payment for, or to anyone involved,
  in criminal activity, since this may be seen as financially
  supporting crime. Note that doing the above for research purposes
  per se, is probably not a sufficient moral or legal defence, and
  some sound legal & ethical reasoning may be required -- as well as
  clear protocols to minimize risks to researchers or society at
  large.

- Besides the above, the research seems to be using Tor as a browser;
  it does not involve any access that all other Tor users would not
  have (eg. it does not involve observing traffic, running
  infrastructure or even hidden services); and no other streams of
  data, besides what is made available by hidden services, is likely
  to be affected. Thus, I would think that the usual protocols for
  collecting PII, and safely interacting with potentially criminal
  activity while conducting research, should cover most concerns.

- Beyond the strict remit of the board: this does sound like an
  interesting project!

[Note these are written in the context of Reviewer A's comments. -PFS]

Interesting, I agree!

I want to underscore two of Reviewer A's points:

1) If you're giving money to bad people, you need to think through the
ethics of that.

2) It's important to consider your own safety when you're buying arbitrary
things from arbitrary people on the Internet.

Both of those are standard IRB topics, and not particularly Tor related,
so we are right to send them to their IRB for more thoughts on those.

And then here's a third one:

3) Some marketplaces (both in onionspace and on the insecure web)
require logins before you can browse the wares -- and some of them put
up barriers to creating the account. At what point do the pages behind
such login requirements stop counting as 'public'? "Anybody could have
done these eighteen steps, so the stuff I found after that isn't private"
is a slippery argument.

But overall, sounds great, thumbs up!

Comments from Reviewer C
---------------------------------------------------------------
This looks like very interesting and potentially quite useful work.  I
look forward to seeing its results.  I see no show-stoppers, but I do
have a few safety recommendations and considerations.

The proposed research is "limited to the coding of the articles that
      we read that have been published for public view on the Internet
      and Dark Internet as well as the products that we receive from
      the purchasing we are going through."

The researchers therefore conclude that there is no risk expected in
conducting this work. Construed strictly in terms of expected Tor
protocol use or gathering of Tor usage network data, that is
true. However there are a few concerns.

1. Safety of the researchers is as important as safety of those
researched.  While obviously you can give yourselves informed consent,
you should take the same precautions as when purchasing or downloading
anything from the Internet, perhaps with a slight increase in caution
if purchasing items or visiting forums that seem potentially to have
higher than normal likelihood of malicious activity, e.g., if focused
on sensitive or controversial issues or goods.  That will of course
depend on the forums in which you participate.  To the extent
practicable, you should at least protect your own identities and
network location.  It would make sense to conduct all your research
via Tor running on a suitably up-to-date and protected system except
where something specific precludes that, e.g. visiting a forum/site
that restricts access from the Tor network). Discussing the context of
and extent to which such blockage is encountered could be a useful
research output of this work.

2. "[P]ublished for public view" is not as straightforward as that
expression might seem.

First of all, as Vitaly Shmatikov is fond of saying, there is no
PII... it's all PII. Cf. his work w/ Arvind Narayanan on deanonymizing
highly dimensional public data using, e.g., publicly posted IMDb
reviews. Coding information from multiple sources potentially runs
that risk, and the research should be conducted cognizant of the sorts
of concerns that research in this space has identified.

Second, you have not said whether sites you will visit/purchase-from
require registration to participate. That is one indicator of privacy
assumptions. But whether the sites require registration or not,
certainly some forums assume information is to be shared only among
participants or otherwise expect discretion and respect for privacy,
e.g., forums for discussion amongst crime or disease abuse
victims. Similarly, for participants in a purchase or other financial
transaction.

Third, even if information is publicly available, it may be that
original sources of that information intended it to remain private in
a way that is violated by public posting. Public posting may have
occurred when others violated those assumptions. 

None of these are Tor-specific safety considerations, but the
researchers should be cautious and cognizant of these themselves and
should make sure that their intended research is acceptable given the
guidelines or evaluation of UMD's IRB or its other institutional bodies
for research involving (even public) data about individuals.
