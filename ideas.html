<h2>Research Ideas</h2>

<p>
If you're interested in anonymity research, you must make it to the
<a href="http://petsymposium.org/">Privacy Enhancing Technologies
Symposium</a>. Everybody who's anybody in the anonymity research world
will be there. Stipends are generally available for people whose presence
will benefit the community.
</p>

<p>To get up to speed on anonymity research, read <a
href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/">these papers</a> (especially the
ones in boxes).
We also keep a list of <a href="techreports.html">Tor Tech Reports</a>
that are (co-)authored by Tor developers.</p>

<p>We need people to attack the system, quantify defenses,
etc. Here are some example projects:</p>

<ul>

<li>What algorithm should we use to assign Guard flags such that a)
we assign the flag to as many relays as possible, yet b) we minimize
the chance that Alice will use an attacker's node as a guard? See the
<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/research-problem-better-guard-rotation-parameters">blog
post</a> for details.
</li>

<li>For various diversity metrics, how has the diversity of
the Tor network changed over time? How robust is it to change or
attack? These results can help us make better design decisions. See the <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/research-problem-measuring-safety-tor-network">blog post</a>
for details.
</li>

<li>If we prevent the really loud users from using too much of the Tor
network, how much can it help? We've instrumented Tor's entry relays
so they can rate-limit connections from users, and we've instrumented
the directory authorities so they can change the rate-limiting
parameters globally across the network. Which parameter values improve
performance for the Tor network as a whole? How should relays adapt
their rate-limiting parameters based on their capacity and based on
the network load they see, and what rate-limiting algorithms will work
best? See the <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/research-problem-adaptive-throttling-tor-clients-entry-guards">blog
post</a> for details.
</li>

<li>Right now Tor clients are willing to reuse a given circuit for ten
minutes after it's first used. The goal is to avoid loading down the
network with too many circuit creations, yet to also avoid having
clients use the same circuit for so long that the exit node can build a
useful pseudonymous profile of them. Alas, ten minutes is probably way
too long, especially if connections from multiple protocols (e.g. IM and
web browsing) are put on the same circuit. If we keep fixed the overall
number of circuit extends that the network needs to do, are there more
efficient and/or safer ways for clients to allocate streams to circuits,
or for clients to build preemptive circuits? Perhaps this research item
needs to start with gathering some traces of what requests typical
clients try to launch, so you have something realistic to try to optimize.
</li>

<li>The "website fingerprinting attack": make a list of a few
hundred popular websites, download their pages, and make a set of
"signatures" for each site. Then observe a Tor client's traffic. As
you watch him receive data, you quickly approach a guess about which
(if any) of those sites he is visiting. First, how effective is
this attack on the deployed Tor design? The problem with all the
previous attack papers is that they look at timing and counting of
IP packets on the wire. But OpenSSL's TLS records, plus Tor's use of
TCP pushback to do rate limiting, means that tracing by IP packets
produces very poor results. The right approach is to realize that
Tor uses OpenSSL, look inside the TLS record at the TLS headers, and
figure out how many 512-byte cells are being sent or received. Then
start exploring defenses: for example, we could change Tor's cell
size from 512 bytes to 1024 bytes, we could employ padding techniques
like <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#timing-fc2004">defensive
dropping</a>, or we could add traffic delays. How much of an impact do
these have, and how much usability impact (using some suitable metric)
is there from a successful defense in each case?</li>

<li>
Path selection algorithms, directory fetching schedules for Tor-on-mobile
that are compatible anonymity-wise with our current approaches.
</li>

<li>More coming soon. See also the "Research" section of the <a
href="https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en#Research">volunteer</a> page for
other topics.
